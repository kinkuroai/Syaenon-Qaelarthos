# INTRODUCTION
 Syaenon Qaelarthos - or __SQ__ - is an experimental ruleset for the game [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).

 SQ is currently a work in progress and I would advise you to stay away from it at the moment as it is still in its baby stages. Although you can try it if you want at this state.

 Suggestions are welcome!

## NOTES
Originally, SQ was a __cheat mod__ called `HBS-Unciv` but decided to rework the mod and turn it into a ruleset. This mod __aims to create total chaos__ as civs will be made powerful enough to f* each other.

__THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS__
