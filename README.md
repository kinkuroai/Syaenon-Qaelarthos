# INTRODUCTION
HBS-Unciv is a bit of a __cheat mod__. It explicitly gives you an advantage in the game. I would advise staying away from this mod if you do not wish to ruin your gaming experience.

## NOTES
Originally, SQ was a __cheat mod__ called `HBS-Unciv` but decided to rework the mod and turn it into a ruleset. This mod __aims to create total chaos__ as civs will be made powerful enough to f* each other. This mod contains overpowered civs and aims to clash them together to create total chaos - that is the plan anyway.

__THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS__
